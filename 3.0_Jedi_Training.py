r=float(input("what is the radius of the circle"))

c=2*3.14*r

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
