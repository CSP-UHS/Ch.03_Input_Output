# Sign your name: Ethan Huynh
# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.

# nm=input("what is your name?")
# print("hello "+nm+" how are you doing today")

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.

# bs=float(input("what is the base of your triangle in centimeters?"))
# ht=float(input("what is the height of your triangle in centimeters"))
# area=bs*ht/2
# print("the area of the triangle was",area,"cm squared!")

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.

# rad=float(input("what is the radius of your circle?"))
# circum=2*3.14*rad
# print("the circumference of your circle is",circum,"squared")

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.


# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
