# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.
#name = str (input("Hi what is your name"))
#print("Nice to meet you" ,name,)

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
#base = int(input("What is the base of the triangle"))
#height = int(input("what is the base of the triangle"))
#tri_area = base * height/2
#print(tri_area)
# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
#rad = int(input("what is the radius of the circle"))
#print(2*3.14*rad)

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
#inter = float(input("Give a number to find the square root of"))
#sqrt = inter ** 0.5
#print("square root is",sqrt)
# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
#print("May the mass times acceleration be with you!")
#mass = float(input("What is the mass"))
#acc = float(input("What is the acceleration"))
#force = mass*acc
#print(force)
#print("Get it")
