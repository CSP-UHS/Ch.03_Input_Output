#Sign your name: Nellie


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints their name to the screen?

# print('Hello What is your Name')
#
# name = input("What's your name?")
#
# print(" Hello," + name + "!")


# 2. Write a a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.

# print("Hey give me a base and a hight")
#
# base = int(input("Enter base"))
#
# height = int(input("Enter height"))
#
# area = (base*height*0.5)
#
# print(area)

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.

# print("Hello what is a radius of a circle?")
#
# radius = int(input()) #this will change the string into a int
#
# print (2 * 3.14 * radius)


# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.

# integer = int(input('Hello! give me an integer!'))
#
# print(integer**.5)

#               5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma.
#       Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.

print("May the times acceleration be with you!")

mass = int(input("give me a mass"))
acceleration = int(input("give me a acceleration"))
F = (mass*acceleration)

print("Because F =", F)
print("Get it!")
