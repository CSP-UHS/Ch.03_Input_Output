#name= str (input("What's your name?"))
#names=print("Hello",name,",it's good to see you!")
# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
#base= float(input("What's the base of the triangle?"))
#height= float(input("What's the height of the triangle?"))
#area=(base*height)/2
#print("The height of the triangle is",area,)
# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
#radius= float(input("What's the raidus of the circle?"))
#circumfrence= 2*3.14*radius
#print ("The circumfrence of the circle is",circumfrence,)


# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
#integer= int (input ("Can you name an integer?"))
#squareroot= integer**0.5
#print("The square root of",integer,"is" ,squareroot)

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
#mass= float(input ("What's the mass?"))
#acceleration= float(input ("What's the acceleration?"))
#force= mass*acceleration
#print("May the",force,"be with you!")
#print("Get it?")
