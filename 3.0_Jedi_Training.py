# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.
# username = input("Hello! What is your name?")
# print("Hello "+username+ ", why do you cry.")

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
# base = float(input("What is the base of your triangle?"))
# height = float(input("What is the height of your triangle?"))
# area = base*height/2
# print("The area of the triangle is" ,area, "yay math")
# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
import math
# radius = float(input("What is the radius of your circle?"))
# circ = 2*radius*math.pi
# print("The circumference of your circle is" ,circ, "now get a calculator you idiot.")

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
# num = int(input("Enter an integer:"))
# sqRt = math.sqrt(num)
# print("The square root of" ,num,"is" ,sqRt,)
# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
# Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
# mass = float(input("What is the mass of the object?"))
# acc = float(input("What is the acceleration of the object?"))
# print("May the" ,mass*acc, "be with you. Get it. It's the force!")
# print("Hello World")
#
# print("Your new score is", 10123+13813, "pts")
#
# print("I want to print a double quote \"Right Here\" ")
#
# print("Hello \nWorld")
#
# print("Hello", end=" ")
# print("World")
