# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!

# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.
# username = input("Hello! What is your name?")
# print("Hello,",username,"how are you doing today?")

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
# base = float(input("What is the base of you triangle?"))
# height = float(input("What is the height of you triangle?"))
# bh = base*height/2
# print("The area of the triangle was",bh,"cm")


# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
# r = float(input("What is the radius of the circle"))
# c = 2*math.pi*r
# print("Curcumfrence of your circle is",c,"meters")

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
# num = int(input("Enter a integer"))
# sq = math.sqrt(num)
# print("The squareroot of",num,"is",sq,)


# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
# m = float(input("What is the mass?"))
# a = float(input("What is the acceleration?"))
# print("May the",m*a,"be with you")
# print("Get it?")







# print("Hello World")
# print ("2*3")
# print(2+3)
# print("Hello World")
#
# print("Your ew score is", 1030+10, "pts")
#
# print("I want to print a double quote \" right here")
#
# print("Hello \n World")
#
# print("Hello",end=" Here is the end character ")
# print("World")

# miles_driven = int(input("Enter the miles driven"))
# gallons_used = float(input("Enter the gallons used"))
# mpg = miles_driven/gallons_used
# print(mpg)
