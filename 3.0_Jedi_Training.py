# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello",name)

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
#base = float(input("Base? "))
#height = float(input("Height? "))
#print(float(base*height*0.5))
# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
#radius = float(input("Radius? "))
#print(float(2*3.14*radius))

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
#integer = float(input("What Number? "))
#sqr = integer**0.5
#print("Your Square Root is:", sqr)

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
#mass = float(input("Mass? "))
#acc = float(input("Acceleration? "))
#F = mass*acc
#print("May the Mass times Acceleration be with you!:",F)
#print("Get it?")
