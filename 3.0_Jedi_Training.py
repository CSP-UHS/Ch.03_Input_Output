# Sign your name: Bryce Huey
# In all the short programs below, do a good job communicating with your end user!


# 1.) Write a program that asks someone for their name and then prints a greeting that uses their name.

# Name = str(input("What is your name? Ans --> "))    #this is used to find out their name
# print("Have a great day", Name,)         #this is the greeting

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle
import math
# base = int(input("What would you like the base to be for this triangle?  ="))
# height = int(input("What would you like the height to be for this triangle?  ="))
# print((base*height)/2)

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.

# ridius = int(input("What would you like the radius to be? "))
# print(ridius * 2 * 3.14)

# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.

# number = int(input("Whats a random number? "))
# print(number **.5)

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.

# Mass = int(input("Whats do you want the mass to be? "))
# acceleration = int(input("Whats do you want the acceleration to be? "))
# print("force =",Mass * acceleration, )
# print("May the mass times acceleration be with you!")
# print("get it?")
